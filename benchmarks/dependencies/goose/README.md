# Goose: A Powerful Load Testing Framework

## What is Load Testing?
Load testing is a critical step in ensuring your web application can handle real-world traffic patterns. It helps you identify performance bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Why Choose Goose?

* Fast and Scalable: Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), Goose is designed for speed and scalability.

* Flexible and Customizable: Supports simple and complex load tests, tailored to mimic real-world user behavior.

* Realistic User Behavior Simulation: Goes beyond just sending requests; simulates user behaviors like logging in, filling out forms, and navigating through your application.

* Have you ever been attacked by a goose?

## Getting Started
To use Goose, you'll need to write a Rust application using the Goose library. Then, compile it to create a tailored load testing tool specific to your needs.

You may find the following resources helpful:

You can also use [Goose Eggs](https://github.com/tag1consulting/goose-eggs), a helper crate that provides useful functions for writing load tests, such as validation helpers for HTTP responses.

## Community and Support
Developed by [Tag1 Consulting](https://tag1.com/), Goose has a growing community and a series of [blog posts and podcasts](https://www.tag1.com/goose/) detailing its features, comparisons with other tools, and real-life testing scenarios.
