# Run-time Flags

**NOTE: Gaggle support was temporarily removed as of Goose 0.17.0 (see https://github.com/tag1consulting/goose/pull/529). Use Goose 0.16.4 if you need the functionality described in this section.**

* `--manager`: starts a Goose process in Manager mode. There currently can only be one Manager per Gaggle.
* `--worker`: starts a Goose process in Worker mode. How many Workers are in a given Gaggle is defined by the `--expect-workers` option, documented below.
* `--no-hash-check`: tells Goose to ignore if the load test application doesn't match between Worker(s) and the Manager. This is not recommended, and can cause the application to panic.

The `--no-metrics`, `--no-reset-metrics`, `--no-status-codes`, and `--no-hash-check` flags must be set on the Manager. Workers inherit these flags from the Manager

# Run-time Options

* `--manager-bind-host <manager-bind-host>`: configures the host that the Manager listens on. By default Goose will listen on all interfaces, or `0.0.0.0`.
* `--manager-bind-port <manager-bind-port>`: configures the port that the Manager listens on. By default Goose will listen on port `5115`.
* `--manager-host <manager-host>`: configures the host that the Worker will talk to the Manager on. By default, a Goose Worker will connect to the localhost, or `127.0.0.1`. In a distributed load test, this must be set to the IP of the Goose Manager.
* `--manager-port <manager-port>`: configures the port that a Worker will talk to the Manager on. By default, a Goose Worker will connect to port `5115`.

The `--users`, `--startup-time`, `--hatch-rate`, `--host`, and `--run-time` options must be set on the Manager. Workers inherit these options from the Manager.

The `--throttle-requests` option must be configured on each Worker, and can be set to a different value on each Worker if desired.
