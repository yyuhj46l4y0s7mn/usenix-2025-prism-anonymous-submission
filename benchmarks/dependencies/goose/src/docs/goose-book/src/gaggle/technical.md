# Gaggle Technical Details

**NOTE: Gaggle support was temporarily removed as of Goose 0.17.0 (see https://github.com/tag1consulting/goose/pull/529). Use Goose 0.16.4 if you need the functionality described in this section.**

Goose uses [`nng`](https://docs.rs/nng/) to send network messages between the Manager and all Workers. [Serde](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/index.html) and [Serde CBOR](https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor) are used to serialize messages into [Concise Binary Object Representation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049).

Workers initiate all network connections, and push metrics to the Manager process.

## Compile-time Feature

Gaggle support is a compile-time Cargo feature that must be enabled. Goose uses the [`nng`](https://docs.rs/nng/) library to manage network connections, and compiling `nng` requires that `cmake` be available.

The `gaggle` feature can be enabled from the command line by adding `--features gaggle` to your cargo command.

When writing load test applications, you can default to compiling in the Gaggle feature in the `dependencies` section of your `Cargo.toml`, for example:

```toml
[dependencies]
goose = { version = "^0.16", features = ["gaggle"] }
```
